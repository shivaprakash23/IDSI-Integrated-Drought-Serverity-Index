This is repository for Integrated Drought Severity Index (IDSI) model . IDSI is empirical model given by IWMI.

##Drought
Drought is a temporary weather event that arises from a lack of rainfall over an extended period, relative to the long-term average conditions. The onset of a drought is typically marked by a decrease in precipitation, but over time, it can lead to a reduction in groundwater, soil moisture, and stream flow.

Drought is a complex event that progresses slowly and steadily, making it challenging to identify its commencement. To gain a clearer understanding of the intricacies of drought, national and international organizations have utilized Remote Sensing data. Simple indices such as NDVI, NDWI, and NDSI provide insights into the current state of vegetation and moisture content.

However, these indices are not comparative. To fully comprehend the complexity of drought, itâ€™s essential to use comparative indices and integrate these indices in some way. This approach allows for a more nuanced understanding of drought conditions and their impacts.

##Integrated Drought Severity Index
Droughts are becoming increasingly prevalent worldwide, particularly in South Asia. The International Water Management Institute (IWMI), located in Colombo, Sri Lanka, conducts scientific research focusing on the sustainable utilization of water and land resources in developing nations.

Drought is a complex event that progresses gradually and steadily, making its onset challenging to detect. Simple indices such as the Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI), Normalized Difference Water Index (NDWI), and Normalized Difference Snow Index (NDSI) provide indications of the current state of vegetation and moisture content.

The IWMI, in collaboration with other research institutes like the Indian Council of Agricultural Research (ICAR), has developed the Integrated Drought Severity Index (IDSI). This index combines three other indices: the Temperature Condition Index (TCI), Precipitation Condition Index (PCI), and Vegetation Condition Index (VCI).
